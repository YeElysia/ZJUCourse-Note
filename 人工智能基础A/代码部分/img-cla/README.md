## Open source licenses

- Part of the code of this project is based on [Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) (AGPL-3.0 license).
- Due to the restrictions of AGPL, this project adopts the AGPL-3.0 license as a whole.
- This is my first time using AGPL-3.0 License. Please point out any errors.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YeElysia/Image-cal.git
   cd Image-cal
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   This project was developed using Python version 3.10.16 and pytorch version "2.7.0+cu128". If you encounter an installation error, please change the pytorch version yourself.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure you have PyTorch installed.

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in the following structure:

   ```
   dataset/
   ├── class_name_1/
   │   ├── *.jpg
   │   └── ...
   └── clss_name_2/
   │   ├── *.jpg
   │   └── ...
   └── ...
   ```

2. Update the `data_dir` variable in `main.py` to point to your dataset directory.

3. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Config setting

The configuration file `default.yaml` contains most of the settings:
